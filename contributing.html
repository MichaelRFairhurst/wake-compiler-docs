			<h1>Wake Developer Guide</h1>
			<p>This is a guide for those who wish to contribute to the compiler, which is mostly written in C++. If you wish to contribute by writing wake libraries, follow the <a href="howto.html">tutorial</a>, and either contribute to an <a href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3AMichaelRFairhurst+wake">existing wake repository</a> or create your own and email it to <a href="mailto:michaelrfairhurst@gmail.com">michaelrfairhurst@gmail.com</a> for inclusion/publication. For the compiler hackers, read on, and take what you learn here into realizing our <a href="roadmap.html">roadmap</a>.</p>
			<h3 id="getting-source">Getting the source</h3>
			<p>If you haven't used git before, install it and check out a tutorial such as <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">this one</a>.</p>
			<p>The wake source is on github <a href="https://github.com/MichaelRFairhurst/wake-compiler">here</a>, you can download it with <code>git clone https://github.com/MichaelRFairhurst/wake-compiler.git</code>.</a>
			<h3 id="building">Building the code</h3>
			<p>You will need gcc, make, flex, bison, nodejs, boost, xxd, and md5sum all installed on your system. Many of these are standard to unix. I have not built it with visual studio or clang before, and am not sure about how difficult it is to compile flex or bison with them. MinGW is probably best for windows, but you could try cygwin if you want. Remember that bison is just a tool, while flex is both a tool and a shared library.</p>
			<p>You will need a compiled version of boost::test and boost::filesystem for your system. If you cannot compile boost::test, that's OK, you'll just miss out on unit tests and risk getting your pull requests turned down from missing tests or test failures. Nonetheless, travis will run these tests for you, so you can get by without it.</p>
			<p>Now run <code>make bin/wake</code>. If you have everything installed and in your path, this should work just fine.<p>
			<h3 id="buildingtests">Running the tests</h3>
			<p>Try <code>make bin/wake TEST=true</code> to run the boost::test unit tests. Everything should work perfectly if you have boost::test installed.</p>
			<p>To run the wake tests, which actually builds wake source code that tests the output of compilations, you'll need <a href="http://build.testception.com/job/wUnit/">the latest wUnit artifacts</a>. Put <code>wunit-compiler</code> in your PATH (it's a js file to be run with nodejs), and by default all of the <code>.o</code> and <code>.table</code> files should be in <code>../wUnit/bin/wakeobj</code> and <code>../wUnit/bin/waketable</code> respectively, but you can change that to whatever you'd like by setting <code>WUNITLIBRARYROOT</code> and <code>WUNITTABLEROOT</code> to something else inside <code>wmake.mk</code>. Now that all that has been done, you can now run <code>make</code>, and you should see a bunch of wake files build, then a unit test output folloowed by a happy printout of tests run vs tests failed.</p>
			<h3 id="issues">Issues</h3>
			<p>Now that you have the code and/or tests building, you can pick a bug or feature from the <a href="https://github.com/MichaelRFairhurst/wake-compiler/issues">Github issue tracker</a>, and get to work. Feel free to ask questions before settling on anything.</p>
			<p>I also want to call out a few milestones and labels. There are different milestones for high vs low priority, and a bucket for all the features we'd like to include. High priority or feature push are a great starting place. For labels, there is a <a href="https://github.com/MichaelRFairhurst/wake-compiler/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abite-sized">bite-sized</a> label for small bugs/features that are great for first taking on. Additionally, semantics, parsing, and codegen have all been split out for those who are interested/more comfortable in one area vs another. The exception to this is the fullstack label, which indicates all of the above will be involved.</p>
			<h3 id="example">How would I, say, add an operator?</h3>
			<p>Many features in the compiler are fullstack, ie, they affect the lexer, parser, type checker, code generator, and of course need tests as well. Whether you are interested in working in all of these areas or a subset, here is an great example of a fullstack pull request <a href="https://github.com/MichaelRFairhurst/wake-compiler/pull/114">here</a>, which added bitwise operators <code>&</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, and <code>&gt;&gt;</code>. Notice how its not as intimidating as you'd think!</p>
			<h3 id="sourcetypes">Source Types in the Compiler</h3>
			<p>If you <code>ls src</code>, you'll see source types flex, bison, c, c++, and wake. The vast majority of the compiler lives in <code>src/cpp</code>. Why the others?</p>
			<p><b>flex</b>: These files contain rules for lexical analysis of wake files. One is for lexing wake source, and the other is for lexing linkable files. Lexing is also called tokenization. Tokenization breaks the text into meaningful chunks, but does not attempt to put any of them in context.</p>
			<p><b>bison</b>: Bison is a parser-generator. You can define rules, and nest rules within them. When a rule is matched, you get to call code. This code creates parse tree, where each matched rule creates a node in the tree. It uses <code>$$</code> to indicate the value returned by a rule match, and it uses <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, ... to indicate the value returned by the first, second, etc matched rules. Once again, we have two files, one for wake source code, and one for linkable files.</p>
			<p><b>c</b>: Bison generates c parsers, and flex generates c lexers, though there are forks that generate C++ ones. For this reason, many things related flex and bison are written in c, such as error printing, and node management.</p>
			<p><b>cpp</b>: The C++ class <code>Parser</code> is a wrapper for the generater bison parser. This connects the c parser to the c++ typechecker and object generator. This holds the vast majority of the code.</p>
			<p><b>wake</b>: This has subdirectories <code>test</code>, which contains wake test programs that assert their own valid execution to test the code generator, and <code>std/table</code>, and <code>std/myobj</code>. The tables are there for convenience. We can compile them to get their <code>.table</code> files, which are binary files describing their interfaces. Automatic imports like primitives and <code>Num</code> are serialized and compiled into the compiler source code. Others are there to expose the interface of handwritten object files that call native javacript libraries, which exist in <code>std/myobj</code>. These files are a temporary means of doing js interop, with a simple script to transform them into a linkable <code>.o</code> file.</p>
			<h3 id="trees">The Wake AST</h3>
			<p>When I first started on the compiler I used a less-than-ideal tree structure for holding the AST. Ironically, the amount that I <i>had</i> researched compiler design gave me a false sense of confidence in the algorithms I'd been taught, which were either outdated or just oversimplified, or a combination of both. As such, the older AST traversers such as <code>ParseTreeTraverser</code>, <code>ClassParseTreeTraverser</code>, and <code>MethodSignatureParseTreeTraverser</code>, etc. as well as the simple+reliable <code>ObjectFileGenerator</code>, all use the node structure defined in <code>tree.h</code> and <code>node.h</code>.</p>
			<p>That tree structure is deprecated and the type checker has been refactored to use <code>AstCreator.cpp</code> to turn the old node structure into the various classes you'll find in <code>include/ast</code>. At the moment hints added by the type checker and given to the code generator are attached via the old tree, and error locations are reported based on the yyloc struct on the old tree as well. In the future I may be convinced to use the Visitor pattern, though I'm not convinced of its value vs simple object composition. Note that not all of the classes in <code>include/ast</code> are yet implemented. These classes are instead handled by the classes <code>OtherExpression</code> and <code>OtherStatement</code>, which allows remnants of the old typechecker to "speak" the language of the new type checker.</p>
			<p>Any brave devs who love refactoring are free to spend time migrating any+all code from the old AST to the new one. It would be most appreciated! Though lets not get <i>too</i> far ahead of ourselves, we have features to build too!</p>
			<h3 id="typechecker">Standard type checking</h3>
			<p>The class <code>TypeChecker</code> is a glue layer; remnants of the old AST. It does a few things fitting of the old AST such as looking for <code>break</code> statements that do not belong, and finding missing return statements. Otherwise, it simply uses <code>AstCreator</code> to create the new AST, and then invokes <code>typeCheck()</code> on the root node it gets back.</p>
			<p>Contributors who have studied compilers will know that the basics of a type checking algorithm is to recurse down an AST tree, stopping on the leafs where we should know their types (such as text and num literals). We then return the type we've found, and anything dealing with, say, addition, can simply ask for the type of the lefthand side and the type of the righthand side, report non-Nums, and return a Num to its parent. This combined with symbol tables which detail variables, methods, and classes, gives us everything we need to make a "variable" node in our AST which returns whatever the symbol table has for it. From there, nearly everything needed to typecheck follows.</p>
			<p>There is an error type which is used in places where nontrivial errors occur. As compared to our addition example, where we know it returns a Num regardless of type errors, problems like an undeclared function or variable are completely unpredictable. Here we return a TYPE_ERROR (thats not like the phrase "type error", but rather corresponds to TYPE_LAMBDA, TYPE_NOTHING, TYPE_CLASS, etc). When other nodes see a TYPE_ERROR they should stop type checking anything involving it, because we simply don't know what the coder intended, and don't want to have crap errors reported that distract from the real cause. Eventually they will fix the underlying type error, compile again, and we'll never be able to catch those subsequent errors any sooner than that.</p>
			<h3 id="typeinfer">Type Inference</h3>
			<p>Wake's type inference is based on scala's. It is not really much of type inference to be honest, but really is just certain nodes allowing a context to be passed in at typecheck time. The example here is <code>T[].sort(Num -- fn(T, T))</code>. We can figure out the value of <code>T[]</code> and therefore <code>T</code> before we start attempting to typecheck the sort function. We then figure out the type of the sort function is really, say, <code>Num -- fn(Text, Text)</code>. We then check if the argument node allows a hint type to be passed in; if it is a variable or method call or something else than we are out of luck. However, if its a lambda declaration such as <code>{ a, b -> return a - b; }</code>, then we are good to go. As the lambda declaration node attempts to bind its arguments into the symbol table so that it may check the lambda body, it sees that arguments <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are missing type data. It therefore uses the type hint to fill in the types.</p>
			<p>One last detail on this, is that when we come across generic methods such as <code>Num[].foldl({ n, a -> return n * a; }, 5)</code>, we cannot use type inference if we are careless in the order we typecheck the arguments. All we know at first is that we accept two arguments, <code>R -- fn(Num, R)</code> and <code>R</code>. If we attempt to typecheck the first argument, we will have no context to apply to the second argument <code>a</code>. We need to instead typecheck the second argument, to find out its a <code>Num</code>, therefore binding <code>R</code> to <code>Num</code>, at which point the type of our first argument becomes the complete context of <code>Num -- fn(Num, Num)</code>, and type inference works. How do we guarantee that this is always done in the right order? Simple; we always typecheck arguments that might try to infer their types last.</p>
			<p>Other type inference is planned, such as declaring vars without their types (eg <code>var a = 5;</code>) and it would be awesome if we could add even more from there, for instance, finding ways to infer lambda arguments when they aren't simply being passed into a method.</p>
			<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
			<p>I have attempted to add unit tests whereever they make sense to <code>src/cpp/test/*.cpp</code>, but often the code is too complex to really benefit from simple unit tests. Not that they ever hurt to write, but most of my tests lie in <code>src/cpp/test/integration/*.cpp</code>. This has a simple macro defined for you where you can write code in Wake, parse it, pass it into the ParseTreeTraverser, and assert that certain semantic errors are found, or that everything passes validation. The macro is <code>PTT_TEST_CASE(test_name, wake_code, assertions)</code>, and the assertions are in the form of macros <code>PTT_EXPECT( semantic error constant )</code> which can be listed out in a row, or <code>PTT_VALID</code> which simply asserts no errors were found. Any unexpected errors fail the tests.</p>
			<p>To test the code generator, unit tests rarely make much sense, so instead we rely on the end-to-end tests in <code>src/wake/test/*.wk</code>. These files are written in Wake, compile via <code>wake</code>, and use the wake unit testing library <code>wUnit</code> to ensure all of the generated code runs with the proper semantics.</p>
