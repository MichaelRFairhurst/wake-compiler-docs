				<h1 id="stdlib">Wake interop plans</h1>
				<p>At the moment our test is javascript. In many ways javascript is the hardest to smoothly target, because it has dynamic features which Wake does not mesh with, and ideally we can perform minification which makes interop hard. We will focus on javascript here for those reasons, but try to allude to other languages where it makes sense.</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>Method overloading</h3>
				<p>I really do want to keep method overloading if at all possible, however it is possible that we may drop it.</p>
				<p>The problem with method overloading is that we simply cannot dynamically find overloads. Not only is that slow, but it also has incorrect semantics, and in places it is impossible (how do you instanceof check a Text--fn()?).</p>
				<p>Once we agree we need to do overloading statically, we wonder how to blend the world of js dynamic overloading with wake static overloading. Defining printer.printLine(Text) vs printLine(Num) leads to a single function named 'printLine' in js, and multiple functions with mangled names in wake. Further, even in classes which do not use overloading, we could actually be given a subtype that does indeed overload those methods.</p>
				<p>So as long as method overloading stays, we need wrappers!</p>
				<h3>Wrapping Wake Classes In Js</h3>
				<p>This is the easy part. We can use reflection to keep our code small and minified but also expose wrappers with the functions we want. On overloads we simply generate a method that throws.</p>
				<p>The algorithm here is as follows: Create a new object. Attach a hidden property "wake original" to that object for usage later. Also attach a property "js representation" to the wake original, which will be returned in the future instead of reperforming this transformation. Loop over properties in the wake object, de-minifying each by dynamically reading the minification table. For each property use Object.getProperty() to have get/set on our js representation to wrap to the wake object. 'Set' should unwrap the 'wake original' before setting it on the wake object. 'Get' should perform this unwrapping on the property before returning it.</p>
				<p>Functions must be transformed, though, still. This is simply a matter of making a function which loops over the arguments, unwraps the 'wake original', and passes those originals into the real function. We can use the 'arguments' if we are ok with the performance loss. I think I am, because I think we will stress that the interoperability layer is for convenience only and its usage should be kept to a minimum. The return value must have the wake-to-js conversion applied.</p>
				<p>We have yet to handle the case where the objects going into the wake layer do not have a 'wake original' property. That is simple, though. All wake objects in use by the js were given to it by a function that translated them and stored the original. Since we are not yet talking about how to use javascript from within wake, this only leaves us to handle numbers, strings, booleans, functions, undefined, and arrays.</p>
				<p>Its easy to see how numbers, strings, and arrays can simply be checked for the "wake original" property. They won't have it and we can leave them alone. Undefined we cannot check for this property, so we must check that its undefined, and once again just leave it alone if it is. Functions passed into wake will only ever be given Wake objects, but the functions we are given are made to accept Js objects. Similarly. they will return js, but must be made to return Wake objects. So when typeof x === 'function', we must create a wrapper function around it before sending it into Wake. Since the function getting passed into Wake may have originated from Wake (and vice versa), we can store these 'wake original' and 'js representation' properties on functions too. However, assuming we have no 'wake original' property to use, our new wrapper must iterate over the arguments and generate js representations of the arguments to pass in the original. The return value should be unwrapped from wake to js.</p>
				<p>So we have now handled all cases for Wake data + primitives being used in both wake and javascript.</p>
				<p>I will note that name mangling must be used in places, like 'provides' and 'public Num[]'. We can use annotations to demangle these names on the class, probably just by storing a minification table on the object that is unique to it, though we should design this to be reusable via inheritance, so that subclasses of classes with annotated demangled names don't wipe out our minification benefits.</p>
				<h3>Being able to call js</h3>
				<p>We simply must be able to call js from wake, or else APIs in javascript that we need (dom, file access, ajax, etc) simply won't be possible.</p>
				<p>A simple solution without broad reprecussions is to use @CustomJavascript annotations to define javascript that takes Wake objects (we can make them js compatible now) and only returns either Wake objects or primitives. This would allow somewhat tedious translation of js libraries like JQuery which don't return primitives often, which is just probably not good enough, but at least meets the promise that you can write libraries in wake and share them, and the standard library will contain wrappers to the common APIs in other languages, and provide our own Wake libraries to do things for other languages from there.</p>
				<h3>Being able to actually call js</h3>
				<p>But screw that! Lets try to let people pass Js data structures into wake...I mean, we're almost there, right?!</p>
				<p>Well first of all, we can still define these native js wrappers, and we can do the same storage of 'wake original' and 'js representation' on our wrappers and their internals. So now, it would seem simply a matter of recognizing that JQuery -- find(Text, JQuery) will get the "js representation" of the JQuery argument, pass it into the wrapped object's "find" method, and then create or reuse the "wake original" to make sure the returned object is the wake version. But from here we are not yet done.</p>
				<p>We now must accept the possibility of a non-extern class accepting an extern class in a method. Exposing MyWakeClass.init(JQuery) is difficult because now we must reevaluate what js representations of wake functions to do translate their arguments.</p>
				<p>JQuery won't have a 'wake original' property, and isn't really a class so we can't use instanceof. We must instead store this as metadata from the function signature itself inside our compiled js.</p>
				<p>We can make a function which takes a function and a list of optional constructors, and iterates over them to wrap the js classes. Any missing constructors use the usual js-to-wake conversion function, any not missing constructors are applied when 'wake original' property is missing (still must not check for that property on undefined!). And it would seem we've done all of the crazy work required to solve the problem, but we haven't yet.</p>
				<p>Now say we have a function "init({T})" on a generic class, or the generic method "{T} init({T})". The goal of generics is to allow a single binary that supports all types you might give it, but in this case we need to create different wrappers for different Ts.</p>
				<p>Firstly, "{T} init({T})" is not a problem, surprisingly. The reason is pretty simple; the method contents of 'init' here simply cannot use T as anything. All it does is takes an essentially unusable object and returns something of the same type. Usig it within wake means wake goes in and wake comes out, using it with js means js goes in and js comes out. It cannot be stored anywhere that could bridge the gap, unless you do things that throw out typesafety.</p>
				<p>So now we must address "WakeClass{T}". Now, since it could have some T property that can be set in wake/retrieved in js, and vice versa, we must make sure that works properly. Luckily, generics are statically used within Wake. This means that we can attach a hidden need -- the need for the constructor of T should it be a jswrapper. So WakeClass{Num} would not provide a ctor, nor would WakeClass{OtherWakeClass}, but WakeClass{JQuery} would pass in the ctor for JQuery which is used the same way as our previous example of a function accepting a JQuery argument.</p>

				<h3>End result</h3>
				<p>Much of this applies to PHP, but without the need for minification (which, as I described, isn't the problem so much as method overloading is). The various consequences of inheritance need to be evaluated...I believe it will still work, either with _.extend or with prototypes. As for php, it should work there too.</p>
